## Description
Over the summer I decided to undergo a project for my business, Soles District. I created a website where I could sell my products online through Shopify. Since creating my website, my website has been one of my most used tools for:
- online ordering
- displaying inventory
- keeping record of up to date inventory
- exploring options for website improvement. 

## Future Plans
1. Increase my inventory to reach more customers
2. Learn to code my own website without Shopify
